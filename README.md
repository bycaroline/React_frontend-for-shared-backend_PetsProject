Project Overview

This repository contains the frontend application built in React as part of a school project. Our team was responsible for developing the user interface that connects to another group's backend API, which provides access to a catalog of pets and users.

The backend (developed by a separate team) handles data storage and endpoints for:

    🐾 Pet information (name, type, age)

    👤 User profiles (registration, login, user details)

Our frontend fetches, displays, and interacts with this data, allowing users to:

    View a list of pets

    Register and log in as users

    Access their profiles

    CRUD operations on their pets
